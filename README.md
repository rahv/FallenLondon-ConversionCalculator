This a small programme based on mechanics in the browser game Fallen London (http://fallenlondon.storynexus.com). 
It calculates the amount of input items needed for conversion into a selected item type. All possible chains of 
conversion are found and displayed, although a lot of these might not actually be practical choices in the game.

Two modes of calculation are available: The first mode minimises the number of input items needed to get the 
selected number of output items. The second mode minimises the actions needed for the conversion. This is 
probably only interesting for players with advanced characters who can easily obtain large quantaties of basic 
items. A simple example: If you need 130 Romantic Notions, the first mode will calculate that you need 650 Drops 
of Prisoner's Honey and will use up 4 actions for conversion. The second mode will calculate that you need 1000 
Drops and convert these in 2 actions.

items appearing here are their intellectual property.
